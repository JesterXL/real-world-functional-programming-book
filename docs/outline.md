Before the "why" of each section, need a quote that states the core idea of the section.
Like curry for exmample: "All functions take 1, and only 1, parameter" or something like that.

- pure functions
    - why
    - same input, same output, no side effects
    - same input
    - same output
    - outside effects
    - inside effects
    - immutability
    - spot the impurities
    - the case for var and let
    - what's not allowed with escape hatches
    - practice: predicates & unit testing with stubs
- getting and setting data
    - why
    - storing data
    - get
    - set
    - lenses
- list comprehensions
    - why
    - impure & pure foreach
    - map
    - impure & pure filtered array
    - filter
    - impure & pure modified type
    - reduce
    - impure & pure everybody
    - each
    - impure & pure at least one
    - some
    - impure & pure merging
- curry and partial application
    - why
    - a lot of arguments vs all functions only take 1
    - create functions from functions
    - partial application
    - creating partials
    - creating curried functions
